### Command
#### /rollback list
Will show a simple list of all the backups available for this world.
#### /rollback create
Creates an automated backup
#### /rollback delete
Takes an index and deletes that backup. This version of this command requires a restart every time you change the "Maximum Backups Per World" option, to work properly. <br>
It can also take the "latest" and "oldest" which will delete the latest/oldest backup.
